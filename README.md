# Hand Gesture based Computer Control System
This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to enable users to control various functionalities using hand gestures. By tracking hand landmarks in real time, the system allows users to:

âœ… Control Volume â€“ Adjust system volume by moving fingers closer or apart

âœ… Finger Counting â€“ Detect the number of fingers held up

âœ… Virtual Cursor â€“ Move the mouse pointer using the index finger

âœ… Gesture Recognition â€“ Detect and respond to predefined gestures

The project is designed for an intuitive, touchless interface, making it useful for accessibility applications, touch-free controls, and interactive experiences.
